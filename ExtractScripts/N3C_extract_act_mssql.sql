--ACT/i2b2 extraction code for N3C
--ACT Ontology Version 2.0.1 and optionally ACT_COVID V3
--Written by Michele Morris, UPitt
--Code written for Oracle
--This extract includes only i2b2 fact relevant tables and the concept dimension table for mapping concept codes
--Assumptions:
--	1. You have already built the N3C_COHORT table (with that name) prior to running this extract
--	2. You are extracting data with a lookback period of 2 years (Not Yet)
--  3. This currently only works for the traditional i2b2 single fact table

-- N3C_VOCAB_MAP and
-- ACT to OMOP Terminology Map
-- Edit if your standard terminology prefixes are different from ACT
-- This does not include local coding
-- For example if your ICD10CM prefix is ICD10 include, but if the code that follows that
-- prefix is not a valid ICD10CM code do not include that prefix
-- Sites that use adapter mapping will need to create a concept_dimension table that links your adapter_mapping 'table'
-- to concept_dimension where the shrine path becomes the concept_path
